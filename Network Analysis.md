# Netwok Analysis

## FINGERPRINTING AND HOST IDENTIFICATION
- Variances in the RFC implementation for different OSâ€™s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
- Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)

## P0F (PASSIVE OS FINGERPRINTING)
- Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
- Configuration stored in:
  - /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
- P0f Signature Database
  - more /etc/p0f/p0f.fp

## NETWORK TRAFFIC SNIFFING
- What makes traffic capture possible?
  - Libpcap
  - WinPcap (outdated)
  - NPCAP

## NETWORK TRAFFIC BASELINING
- Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
- No industry standard
- 7 days to establish the initial snapshot
- Prerequisite Information

## NETWORK BASELINE OBJECTIVE
- Determines the current state of your network
- Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
- Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
- Verify port / protocol usage

## ANALYZE NETWORK TRAFFIC STATISTICS
- Protocol Hierarchy
- Conversations
- Endpoints
- I/O Graph
- IPv4 and IPv6 Statistics
- Expert Information
```
sudo tcpdump -r analysis-demo.pcap 'tcp[13] = 0x02' | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d. -f1,2,3,4 | sort | uniq -c
```

## ANOMALY DETECTION
- Indicator of Attack (IOA)
  - Proactive
  - A series of actions that are suspicious together
  - Focus on Intent
  - Looks for what must happen
    - Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.

## ANOMALY DETECTION
- Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
  - Reactive
  - Forensic Evidence
  - Provides Information that can change
    - Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures

## INDICATORS

- NOP sled
- Repeated Letters
- Well Known Signatures
- Mismatched Protocols
- Unusual traffic
- Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times

## POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF ATTACK
